# docs: thin router to the documentation layer

S-layer pointer only — the norms live in the documents (L layer). Re-read what you cite; never quote from memory.

## 1. User dissatisfaction → triage first, consent before any self-audit

When the user reports dissatisfaction with your behavior, do **not** launch an analysis on your own:

- **Not a plugin/kernel matter** (pure conversation, execution slip)? Ignore the rest of this skill — respond to the user directly, fix in-session.
- **Possibly a plugin or kernel problem?** First ask the user whether to run a behavior self-audit (**recommended** — it produces the evidence base for a real fix). Only on consent, follow the protocol: [`.meta/docs/agent-behavior.md`](../../docs/agent-behavior.md) — feedback handling → routing → the seven-step standard.

## 2. "Where is X documented?" / "how does X work?"

Read [`.meta/docs/map.md`](../../docs/map.md) — the routing table (what to read when), framework docs and package-repo docs both.

## 3. Filing feedback / issues

The routing table lives in [`.meta/docs/agent-behavior.md`](../../docs/agent-behavior.md) §Routing: framework → vault-wiki; package members → the matching `pkg-*` repo; new-plugin proposals → incubation on vault-wiki.
